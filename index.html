            <ul>
                <li>The Mac we know today was originally named the <i>Macintosh</i>, and it was introduced to the world
                    on January 24, 1984. The year before, both Apple and IMB held a stead grasp on the computer
                    industry, and they were the two top competitors in the computer industry. When 1984 rolled around
                    however, IMB was the dominating force in the computer industry, and it seemed like no one could stop
                    them. That was until Apple introduced their new desktop computer, the <i>Macintosh</i>. Apple truly
                    believed the new product would be legendary, and used the phrase "you'll see why 1984 won't be like
                    "1984."" Products like the <i>Macintosh</i> were still extraordinary for there time, as there were
                    only two major products before it. The Apple II released in 1977 and the IBM PC released in 1981.
                    Apple President Steve Jobs called the <i>Macintosh</i> "the third industry milestone prodcut" and
                    said that it turned out "insanely great." Jobs's declaration of the third landmark industry
                    milestone product turned out to be correct, as it was incredibly successful, which is what Apple
                    needed after the complete failture of their busniess computer: the Apple Lisa. The <i>Macintosh</i>
                    was meant to appeal to the masses, rather than just businessmen, which was a reason for its success.
                    After the release of the <i>Macintosh</i>, the competition changed from the industry titan that was
                    IMB to a partnership between Microsoft and Intel. Apple dropped the ball the next few years, as they
                    failed to establish the Mac as an industry standard, and when Microsoft released Windows 3.0, that
                    opportunity seemed to fade away.</li>

                <li>Apple began falling off in 1992 when they released a series of underpowered Macs named Performas.
                    The previously mentioned partnership of Microsoft and Intel and the release of Windows 3.0 made
                    things even worse for Apple. Apple was losing its grasp on the market, as it was reported that
                    Windows was being used by 25 million people. Apple was not completely done for, as they released a
                    new set of Macs called the Power Macs in 1994. These Macs boasted the new PowerPC chip, making them
                    much more powerful than what Apple had released before. While the Power Macs were selling well,
                    other underwhelming Apple products alongside the growing popularity of Windows 95 and Intel's
                    Pentium CPUs continued to stack the deck against Apple. In 1996, Apple bought Steve Jobs's company
                    NeXT and its operating system. <i>Steve Jobs had returned to Apple and in 1997 became the interim
                        CEO of the company.</i> Apple had too many products, too little customers, and were losing
                    money. Steve Jobs said that he believed Apple could die if not given the proper attention. To solve
                    their money problem, they convinced Bill Gates to buy $150 million worth of shares in Apple. Jobs
                    got rid of the unecessary Apple products and began work on Rhapsody, the precursor to Mac OS X. In
                    1998, Apple released a product that took them back to their roots: the iMac. This all in one system
                    featured a 15 inch screen, easy internet hookup, and usb ports. It was a huge sucess all over the
                    world.</li>

                <li>When people think of Mac, most people think of the Macbook, but the laptop versions of the Macintosh
                    did not start with the MacBook. Instead, they started with the Macintosh Portable. The Macintosh
                    Portable was not very successful though, so Apple bounced back with a series of laptops that Apple
                    named the <i>PowerBook</i>. The first <i>PowerBook</i> released by Apple was the <i>PowerBook
                        100</i>, which was released in 1991. The <i>PowerBook 100</i> retailed for $2,500 and boasted a
                    great set of features. The <i>PowerBook 100</i> had a set-back keyboard, a palm rest, and instead of
                    the trackpad that we are all used to using, it featured a trackball. The <i>PowerBook 100</i> was a
                    huge success for Apple, leading them to create more models of it. The <i>PowerBook 500</i> released
                    in 1994 and retailed for $2,270. It featured a 9.5 inch screen, a small upgrade from the
                    <i>PowerBook 100's</i> 9 inch screen, built-in Ethernet, stereo speakers, and it replaced the
                    trackball with the trackpad that we know today. The next installment in the <i>PowerBook</i> line
                    was the <i>PowerBook G3</i>. The <i>PowerBook G3</i> featured a massive increase in screen size,
                    going from 9.5 inches to 14.1 inches. Retailing for $1,999, it also featured CD-ROM and DVD-ROM
                    drives. The <i>PowerBook Titanium G4</i> released in 2001 for $2,599. This version of the
                    <i>Powerbook</i> is visually the most similar to the MacBooks we know today. The G4 in it's name
                    comes from the PowerPC G4 Processor that the laptop comes with, and the titanium in the name comes
                    from the laptop's titanium metal body. This <i>PowerBook</i> features a screen size increase from
                    14.1 inches to 15.2 inches.</li>

                <li><i>Mac OS X</i> got off to a bit of a rocky start in 2000. <i>Mac OS X</i> looked goood initially,
                    but it lacked features and was too slow. Apple's current products receive nothing more than some
                    speed boosts and new colors. Apple's new product, the Power Mac G4 Cube, is a total flop, being too
                    expensive and having cracks in its casing. Things kept getting worse with the release of <i>Mac OS X
                        10.1</i> in 2001. It still lacked features and was so slow that the "spinning beach ball of
                    death" that appeared when the computer froze or was experiencing difficulties became a common thing
                    for many Mac users. Apple then released a new iMac with two awful designs. The Flower Power and Blue
                    Dalmatian designs were so terrible that it kept many people from buying it. Apple begins to pick
                    itself back up in 2002, with the release of a revamped iMac with a semi-spherical base and a flat
                    screen supported by a chrome arm. 2002 also saw the release of <i>Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar</i> which
                    finally gave new features and speed boosts. In 2004, the iMac ditches its new design for an
                    all-in-one design that puts the computer behind a flat LCD screen. This is the design that we know
                    today. In 2006, Apple replaced the PowerPC chips they had been using since 1994 with Intel Core Duo
                    processors. 2007 was a huge year for Apple, as they introduced the iPhone to the world. But they
                    didn't forget about Mac, as <i>Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</i> released that year and became their biggest
                    selling OS X upgrade.</i></li>

                <li>In 2008, Apple announced that their Mac Pros will offer 8-core processing as a standard, and that
                    their iMacs, MacBooks, and MacBook Pros would be faster. But their big announcement that year would
                    be the <i>MacBook Air</i>, a lighter laptop with a multi-touch trackpad. The next year would feature
                    the release of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and the new <i>13.3 inch version of the MacBook Pro</i>.
                    2010 sees the Mac App Store shine and the release of the MacBook Air. <i>OS X Lion</i> makes history
                    with its release in 2011, as it is the first version of OS X to be released on a disc format. It was
                    instead downloaded via the Mac App Store. OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion releases in 2012 and brings a more
                    iOS-like style to the Mac. The MacBook Pro received a new Retina display along with HDMI ports. 2013
                    saw the release of OS X 10.9 Maverick and the <i>Mac Pro</i>. In 2015, Apple had a new vision for
                    Macs with the new MacBook. The 2015 MacBook (and the MacBooks beyond) would have design elements
                    from the newest iPhones and iPads. Apple released the <i>iMac Pro</i> in 2017. This was one of
                    Apple's most powerful products, coming with 32 gigabytes of RAM, Intel Xeon processors, and an AMD
                    Radeon Pro Vega 56 graphics card. It was also one of the most expensive products Apple ever
                    released, as just the base model retailed for $4,999. Apple upgraded many of their products in 2018,
                    including giving the MacBook Air a thinner design with a better screen.</li>

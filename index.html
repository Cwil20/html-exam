            <ul>
                <li>The Mac we know today was originally named the <i>Macintosh</i>, and it was introduced to the world
                    on January 24, 1984. The year before, both Apple and IMB held a stead grasp on the computer
                    industry, and they were the two top competitors in the computer industry. When 1984 rolled around
                    however, IMB was the dominating force in the computer industry, and it seemed like no one could stop
                    them. That was until Apple introduced their new desktop computer, the <i>Macintosh</i>. Apple truly
                    believed the new product would be legendary, and used the phrase "you'll see why 1984 won't be like
                    "1984."" Products like the <i>Macintosh</i> were still extraordinary for there time, as there were
                    only two major products before it. The Apple II released in 1977 and the IBM PC released in 1981.
                    Apple President Steve Jobs called the <i>Macintosh</i> "the third industry milestone prodcut" and
                    said that it turned out "insanely great." Jobs's declaration of the third landmark industry
                    milestone product turned out to be correct, as it was incredibly successful, which is what Apple
                    needed after the complete failture of their busniess computer: the Apple Lisa. The <i>Macintosh</i>
                    was meant to appeal to the masses, rather than just businessmen, which was a reason for its success.
                    After the release of the <i>Macintosh</i>, the competition changed from the industry titan that was
                    IMB to a partnership between Microsoft and Intel. Apple dropped the ball the next few years, as they
                    failed to establish the Mac as an industry standard, and when Microsoft released Windows 3.0, that
                    opportunity seemed to fade away.</li>

                <li>When people think of Mac, most people think of the Macbook, but the laptop versions of the Macintosh did not start with the MacBook. Instead, they started with the Macintosh Portable. The Macintosh Portable was not very successful though, so Apple bounced back with a series of laptops that Apple named the <i>PowerBook</i>. The first <i>PowerBook</i> released by Apple was the <i>PowerBook 100</i>. Retailing for $2,500, </li>

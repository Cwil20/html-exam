                <li><i>Mac OS X</i> got off to a bit of a rocky start in 2000. <i>Mac OS X</i> looked goood initially,
                    but it lacked features and was too slow. Apple's current products receive nothing more than some
                    speed boosts and new colors. Apple's new product, the Power Mac G4 Cube, is a total flop, being too
                    expensive and having cracks in its casing. Things kept getting worse with the release of <i>Mac OS X
                        10.1</i> in 2001. It still lacked features and was so slow that the "spinning beach ball of
                    death" that appeared when the computer froze or was experiencing difficulties became a common thing
                    for many Mac users. Apple then released a new iMac with two awful designs. The Flower Power and Blue
                    Dalmatian designs were so terrible that it kept many people from buying it. Apple begins to pick
                    itself back up in 2002, with the release of a revamped iMac with a semi-spherical base and a flat
                    screen supported by a chrome arm. 2002 also saw the release of <i>Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar</i> which
                    finally gave new features and speed boosts. In 2004, the iMac ditches its new design for an
                    all-in-one design that puts the computer behind a flat LCD screen. This is the design that we know
                    today. In 2006, Apple replaced the PowerPC chips they had been using since 1994 with Intel Core Duo
                    processors. 2007 was a huge year for Apple, as they introduced the iPhone to the world. But they
                    didn't forget about Mac, as <i>Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</i> released that year and became their biggest
                    selling OS X upgrade.</i></li>

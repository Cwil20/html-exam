                <li>When people think of Mac, most people think of the Macbook, but the laptop versions of the Macintosh
                    did not start with the MacBook. Instead, they started with the Macintosh Portable. The Macintosh
                    Portable was not very successful though, so Apple bounced back with a series of laptops that Apple
                    named the <i>PowerBook</i>. The first <i>PowerBook</i> released by Apple was the <i>PowerBook
                    100</i>, which was released in 1991. The <i>PowerBook 100</i> retailed for $2,500 and boasted a
                    great set of features. The <i>PowerBook 100</i> had a set-back keyboard, a palm rest, and instead of
                    the trackpad that we are all used to using, it featured a trackball. The <i>PowerBook 100</i> was a
                    huge success for Apple, leading them to create more models of it. The <i>PowerBook 500</i> released
                    in 1994 and retailed for $2,270. It featured a 9.5 inch screen, a small upgrade from the
                    <i>PowerBook 100's</i> 9 inch screen, built-in Ethernet, stereo speakers, and it replaced the
                    trackball with the trackpad that we know today. The next installment in the <i>PowerBook</i> line
                    was the <i>PowerBook G3</i>. The <i>PowerBook G3</i> featured a massive increase in screen size,
                    going from 9.5 inches to 14.1 inches. Retailing for $1,999, it also featured CD-ROM and DVD-ROM
                    drives. The <i>PowerBook Titanium G4</i> released in 2001 for $2,599. This version of the
                    <i>Powerbook</i> is visually the most similar to the MacBooks we know today. The G4 in it's name
                    comes from the PowerPC G4 Processor that the laptop comes with, and the titanium in the name comes
                    from the laptop's titanium metal body. This <i>PowerBook</i> features a screen size increase from
                    14.1 inches to 15.2 inches.</li>

                <li>Apple began falling off in 1992 when they released a series of underpowered Macs named Performas.
                    The previously mentioned partnership of Microsoft and Intel and the release of Windows 3.0 made
                    things even worse for Apple. Apple was losing its grasp on the market, as it was reported that
                    Windows was being used by 25 million people. Apple was not completely done for, as they released a
                    new set of Macs called the Power Macs in 1994. These Macs boasted the new PowerPC chip, making them
                    much more powerful than what Apple had released before. While the Power Macs were selling well,
                    other underwhelming Apple products alongside the growing popularity of Windows 95 and Intel's
                    Pentium CPUs continued to stack the deck against Apple. In 1996, Apple bought Steve Jobs's company
                    NeXT and its operating system. <i>Steve Jobs had returned to Apple and in 1997 became the interim
                        CEO of the company.</i> Apple had too many products, too little customers, and were losing
                    money. Steve Jobs said that he believed Apple could die if not given the proper attention. To solve
                    their money problem, they convinced Bill Gates to buy $150 million worth of shares in Apple. Jobs
                    got rid of the unecessary Apple products and began work on Rhapsody, the precursor to Mac OS X. In
                    1998, Apple released a product that took them back to their roots: the iMac. This all in one system
                    featured a 15 inch screen, easy internet hookup, and usb ports. It was a huge sucess all over the
                    world.</li>
